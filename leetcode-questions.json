Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:\nIf the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.\nIf the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).\nOnly powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10.

Thus the compressed string becomes \"23321511\".\nGiven a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: \"1211\"\nExplanation:\ncountAndSay(1) = \"1\"\ncountAndSay(2) = RLE of \"1\" = \"11\"\ncountAndSay(3) = RLE of \"11\" = \"21\"\ncountAndSay(4) = RLE of \"21\" = \"1211\"\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: \"1\"\nExplanation:\nThis is the base case.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= n <= 30\n  Follow up: Could you solve it iteratively?",

    "description": "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\nThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\nNote that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\nCustom Judge:\nThe inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\nintersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\nlistA - The first linked list.\nlistB - The second linked list.\nskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\nskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n  Example 1:\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\nExample 2:\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at '2'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\nExample 3:\nInput: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\nOutput: No intersection\nExplanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n  Constraints:\nThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\nThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n0 <= skipA <= m\n0 <= skipB <= n\nintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\nintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n  Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?",

    "description": "The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.\nThe knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.\nSome of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).\nTo reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.\nReturn the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.\nNote that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.\n  Example 1:\nInput: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.\nExample 2:\nInput: dungeon = [[0]]\nOutput: 1\n  Constraints:\nm == dungeon.length\nn == dungeon[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 200\n-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000",

Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100\nOutput:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)\nExplanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101\nOutput:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)\nExplanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.\n  Constraints:\nThe input must be a binary string of length 32\n  Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?",

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\nThe next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.\nGiven the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.\nNote that you do not need to return anything.\n  Example 1:\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\nExample 2:\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n  Constraints:\nm == board.length\nn == board[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 25\nboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n  Follow up:\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).

Note that the '\\n' and '\\t' are the new-line and tab characters.\nEvery file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

    "description": "Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n  Example 1:\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n  Constraints:\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\nn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6",

For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.\nTo determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.\nThe functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.\n  Example 1:\nInput\n[\"LFUCache\", \"put\", \"put\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"get\"]\n[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]\n\nExplanation\n// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x\n// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)\nLFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);\nlfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1\nlfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1\nlfu.get(1);      // return 1\n                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2\nlfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3\nlfu.get(4);      // return 4\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3\n  Constraints:\n1 <= capacity <= 104\n0 <= key <= 105\n0 <= value <= 109\nAt most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.\n ",

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.\nYou are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.\nInitially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\nPick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n  Example 1:\nInput: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\nExample 2:\nInput: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]\nOutput: 6\n  Constraints:\n1 <= k <= 105\n0 <= w <= 109\nn == profits.length\nn == capital.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n0 <= profits[i] <= 104\n0 <= capital[i] <= 109",

Besides, each node has two attributes:\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\nisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n  Example 1:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.\nIf we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.\nNotice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.\nExample 2:\nInput: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\nExplanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.\nThe resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.\n  Constraints:\nquadTree1 and quadTree2 are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a n * n grid.\nn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 9.",

Otherwise, the code is invalid.\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n  Example 1:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\nExample 2:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\nExample 3:\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced.

    "description": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\nNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\nParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\nIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\nIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\nOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n  Example 1:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: \"1(2(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be \"1(2(4))(3)\".\nExample 2:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: \"1(2()(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n  Constraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000",

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\nOne of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\nImplement the MyCircularQueue class:\nMyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\nint Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\nint Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\nboolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\nboolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\nboolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\nboolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\nYou must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language. \n  Example 1:\nInput\n[\"MyCircularQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\", \"isFull\", \"deQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\"]\n[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]\nOutput\n[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]\n\nExplanation\nMyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3\nmyCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True\nmyCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4\n  Constraints:\n1 <= k <= 1000\n0 <= value <= 1000\nAt most 3000 calls will be made to enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear, isEmpty, and isFull.",

Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= logs.length <= 500\n0 <= function_id < n\n0 <= timestamp <= 109\nNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\nNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\nEach function has an \"end\" log for each \"start\" log.",

For example, \"11106\" can be mapped into:\n\"AAJF\" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)\n\"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10 6)\nNote that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because \"06\" cannot be mapped into 'F' since \"6\" is different from \"06\".\nIn addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message \"1*\" may represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\".

It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.\nAfter each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.\nReturn an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.\n  Example 1:\nInput: positions = [[1,2],[2,3],[6,1]]\nOutput: [2,5,5]\nExplanation:\nAfter the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2.\nAfter the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\nAfter the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.\nThus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].\nExample 2:\nInput: positions = [[100,100],[200,100]]\nOutput: [100,100]\nExplanation:\nAfter the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100.\nAfter the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100.\nThus, we return an answer of [100, 100].\nNote that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= positions.length <= 1000\n1 <= lefti <= 108\n1 <= sideLengthi <= 106",

    "description": "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\nThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\nThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n  Example 1:\nInput: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\nExample 2:\nInput: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n  Constraints:\n1 <= source.length <= 100\n0 <= source[i].length <= 80\nsource[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\nThere are no single-quote or double-quote in the input.",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\nA let expression takes the form \"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)\", where let is always the string \"let\", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.\nAn add expression takes the form \"(add e1 e2)\" where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\nA mult expression takes the form \"(mult e1 e2)\" where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\nFor this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.

It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n  Example 1:\nInput: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\nExample 2:\nInput: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\nExample 3:\nInput: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= expression.length <= 2000\nThere are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.\nAll tokens are separated by a single space in expression.\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\nThe expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.",

It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.\nReturn the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.\nNote that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.

In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:\nChoose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].\nThis choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.\nIf next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.\nThe game ends when you reach the square n2.\nA board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.\nNote that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per dice roll. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.\nFor example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.\nReturn the least number of dice rolls required to reach the square n2.

Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\nYou may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value.

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\nSee more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nImplement the Skiplist class:\nSkiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.\nbool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.\nvoid add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.\nbool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n  Example 1:\nInput\n[\"Skiplist\", \"add\", \"add\", \"add\", \"search\", \"add\", \"search\", \"erase\", \"erase\", \"search\"]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n\nExplanation\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n  Constraints:\n0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104\nAt most 5 * 104 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.",

If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.\nYou are given an array of strings votes which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.\nReturn a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.\n  Example 1:\nInput: votes = [\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ABC\",\"ACB\",\"ACB\"]\nOutput: \"ACB\"\nExplanation: \nTeam A was ranked first place by 5 voters.

More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).\nFor arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The median is 6.\nFor arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1. The median is 3.\n  Example 1:\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2\nOutput: [5,1]\nExplanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.\nPlease note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.\nExample 2:\nInput: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2\nOutput: [5,5]\nExplanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].\nExample 3:\nInput: arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5\nOutput: [11,8,6,6,7]\nExplanation: Median is 7, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [11,8,6,6,7,7].\nAny permutation of [11,8,6,6,7] is accepted.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= arr.length <= 105\n-105 <= arr[i] <= 105\n1 <= k <= arr.length",

If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.\nGiven an integer array rains where:\nrains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.\nrains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.\nReturn an array ans where:\nans.length == rains.length\nans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.\nans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\nFind all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]\nExplanation: The figure above describes the graph.\nThe following figure shows all the possible MSTs:\nNotice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.\nThe edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges.

    "description": "Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string \"aabccc\" we replace \"aa\" by \"a2\" and replace \"ccc\" by \"c3\". Thus the compressed string becomes \"a2bc3\".\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.\nGiven a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.\nFind the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.\n  Example 1:\nInput: s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything.

    "description": "Given a wooden stick of length n units. The stick is labelled from 0 to n. For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:\nGiven an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.\nYou should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.\nThe cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.\nReturn the minimum total cost of the cuts.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:\nThe first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.\nRearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]\nOutput: 22\nExplanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.\nThere are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.\n  Constraints:\n2 <= n <= 106\n1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)\n1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1\nAll the integers in cuts array are distinct.",

For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.\nYou are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete).

The ship will follow these steps:\nThe ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.\nFor each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it.

Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).\nGiven three integers a, b, and c, return the maximum score you can get.\n  Example 1:\nInput: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.

The orderTypei is:\n0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or\n1 if it is a batch of sell orders.\nNote that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.\nThere is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\nIf the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.\nVice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog.

There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed.

The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]\nOutput: 999999984\nExplanation: Here is what happens with the orders:\n- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed.

The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.\nAfter you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.\nFor example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.\nHowever, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour.

A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1) and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].\nReturn a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of farmland in land. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.\n  Example 1:\nInput: land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]\nExplanation:\nThe first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].\nThe second group has a top left corner at land[1][1] and a bottom right corner at land[2][2].\nExample 2:\nInput: land = [[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0,1,1]]\nExplanation:\nThe first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[1][1].\nExample 3:\nInput: land = [[0]]\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\nThere are no groups of farmland.\n  Constraints:\nm == land.length\nn == land[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 300\nland consists of only 0's and 1's.\nGroups of farmland are rectangular in shape.",

The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.\nThe data structure should support the following functions:\nLock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.\nUnlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.\nUpgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:\nThe node is unlocked,\nIt has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and\nIt does not have any locked ancestors.\nImplement the LockingTree class:\nLockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.\nlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise.

    "description": "You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\nSince the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:\nCount all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.\nFor example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.\nDenote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.\nFor example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.\nFinally, represent the product as a string \"<pre>...<suf>eC\".\nFor example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as \"12345...89876e5\".\nReturn a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\n  Example 1:\nInput: left = 1, right = 4\nOutput: \"24e0\"\nExplanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.\nThere are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with \"e0\".\nSince the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.\nThus, the final representation is \"24e0\".\nExample 2:\nInput: left = 2, right = 11\nOutput: \"399168e2\"\nExplanation: The product is 39916800.\nThere are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with \"e2\".\nThe number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.\nHence, the abbreviated product is \"399168e2\".\nExample 3:\nInput: left = 371, right = 375\nOutput: \"7219856259e3\"\nExplanation: The product is 7219856259000.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= left <= right <= 104",

These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.\nThe twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.\nGiven the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.\n  Example 1:\nInput: head = [5,4,2,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nNodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.\nThere are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. \nExample 2:\nInput: head = [4,2,2,3]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation:\nThe nodes with twins present in this linked list are:\n- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.\n- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.\nThus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. \nExample 3:\nInput: head = [1,100000]\nOutput: 100001\nExplanation:\nThere is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.\n  Constraints:\nThe number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].\n1 <= Node.val <= 105",

The integers in the grid represent the following:\n0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.\n1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.\nAll other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.\nIt takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.\nYou are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.\nYou are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:\nDistance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).\nPrice (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).\nThe row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).\nThe column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).\nReturn the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.\n  Example 1:\nInput: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0], k = 3\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]\nExplanation: You start at (0,0).\nWith a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).\nThe ranks of these items are:\n- (0,1) with distance 1\n- (1,1) with distance 2\n- (2,1) with distance 3\n- (2,2) with distance 4\nThus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2\nOutput: [[2,1],[1,2]]\nExplanation: You start at (2,3).\nWith a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).\nThe ranks of these items are:\n- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2\n- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3\n- (1,1) with distance 3\n- (0,1) with distance 4\nThus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3\nOutput: [[2,1],[2,0]]\nExplanation: You start at (0,0).\nWith a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). \nThe ranks of these items are: \n- (2,1) with distance 5\n- (2,0) with distance 6\nThus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0). \nNote that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.\n  Constraints:\nm == grid.length\nn == grid[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 105\n1 <= m * n <= 105\n0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105\npricing.length == 2\n2 <= low <= high <= 105\nstart.length == 2\n0 <= row <= m - 1\n0 <= col <= n - 1\ngrid[row][col] > 0\n1 <= k <= m * n",

It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,\nYou push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.\nYou push 0 0 0 8 (four digits).

Each moving car has the same speed.\nThe number of collisions can be calculated as follows:\nWhen two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.\nWhen a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.\nAfter a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.\nReturn the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.\n  Example 1:\nInput: directions = \"RLRSLL\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nThe collisions that will happen on the road are:\n- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other.

You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.\nYou are also given an integer k. You should allocate piles of candies to k children such that each child gets the same number of candies. Each child can take at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.\nReturn the maximum number of candies each child can get.\n  Example 1:\nInput: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.\nExample 2:\nInput: candies = [2,5], k = 11\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.\n  Constraints:\n1 <= candies.length <= 105\n1 <= candies[i] <= 107\n1 <= k <= 1012",

If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.\nReturn s after all rounds have been completed.\n  Example 1:\nInput: s = \"11111222223\", k = 3\nOutput: \"135\"\nExplanation: \n- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: \"111\", \"112\", \"222\", and \"23\".\n  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. \n  So, s becomes \"3\" + \"4\" + \"6\" + \"5\" = \"3465\" after the first round.\n- For the second round, we divide s into \"346\" and \"5\".\n  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. \n  So, s becomes \"13\" + \"5\" = \"135\" after second round. \nNow, s.length <= k, so we return \"135\" as the answer.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"00000000\", k = 3\nOutput: \"000\"\nExplanation: \nWe divide s into \"000\", \"000\", and \"00\".\nThen we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. \ns becomes \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" = \"000\", whose length is equal to k, so we return \"000\".\n  Constraints:\n1 <= s.length <= 100\n2 <= k <= 100\ns consists of digits only.",

The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.\nPlease solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.\n  Example 1:\nInput\narr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\nn = 0\nOutput\n[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\n\nExplanation\nPassing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. \nExample 2:\nInput\narr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\nn = 1\nOutput\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\nExplanation\nThe subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its depth is 1.\nExample 3:\nInput\narr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]\nn = 2\nOutput\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\nExplanation\nThe maximum depth of any subarray is 1. Thus, all of them are flattened.\n  Constraints:\n0 <= count of numbers in arr <= 105\n0 <= count of subarrays in arr <= 105\nmaxDepth <= 1000\n-1000 <= each number <= 1000\n0 <= n <= 1000",

    "url": "https://www.leetcode.com/problems/design-cancellable-function",
    "description": "Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.\nYou may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.\nIf the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string \"Cancelled\" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.\nWhen the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.\nAn example of how your code would be used:\nfunction* tasks() {\n  const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2));\n  yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n  return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done.\n}\nconst [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks());\nsetTimeout(cancel, 50);\npromise.catch(console.log); // logs \"Cancelled\" at t=50ms\nIf instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.\n  Example 1:\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  return 42; \n}\ncancelledAt = 100\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 42}\nExplanation:\nconst generator = generatorFunction();\nconst [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator);\nsetTimeout(cancel, 100);\npromise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms\n\nThe generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(\"Hello\")); \n  throw `Error: ${msg}`; \n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"rejected\": \"Error: Hello\"}\nExplanation:\nA promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error.\nExample 3:\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); \n  return \"Success\"; \n}\ncancelledAt = 100\nOutput: {\"rejected\": \"Cancelled\"}\nExplanation:\nWhile the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error.\nExample 4:\nInput:\ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  let result = 0; \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));\n  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n  result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  return result;\n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 2}\nExplanation:\n4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise.\nExample 5:\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  let result = 0; \n  try { \n    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n    yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); \n    result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); \n  } catch(e) { \n    return result; \n  } \n  return result; \n}\ncancelledAt = 150\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 1}\nExplanation:\nThe first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise.\nExample 6:\nInput: \ngeneratorFunction = function*() { \n  try { \n    yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(\"Promise Rejected\")); \n  } catch(e) { \n    let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2));\n    let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); \n    return a + b; \n  }; \n}\ncancelledAt = null\nOutput: {\"resolved\": 4}\nExplanation:\nThe first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4.\n  Constraints:\ncancelledAt == null or 0 <= cancelledAt <= 1000\ngeneratorFunction returns a generator object",

The root of the tree is node 1 and each node i in the tree has two children where the left child is the node 2 * i and the right child is 2 * i + 1.\nEach node in the tree also has a cost represented by a given 0-indexed integer array cost of size n where cost[i] is the cost of node i + 1. You are allowed to increment the cost of any node by 1 any number of times.\nReturn the minimum number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal.\nNote:\nA perfect binary tree is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children.\nThe cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path.\n  Example 1:\nInput: n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We can do the following increments:\n- Increase the cost of node 4 one time.\n- Increase the cost of node 3 three times.\n- Increase the cost of node 7 two times.\nEach path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9.\nThe total increments we did is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum answer we can achieve.\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 3, cost = [5,3,3]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The two paths already have equal total costs, so no increments are needed.\n  Constraints:\n3 <= n <= 105\nn + 1 is a power of 2\ncost.length == n\n1 <= cost[i] <= 104",

All integers in positions are unique.\nAll robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.\nIf two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.\nYour task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.\nReturn an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.\nNote: The positions may be unsorted.\n    Example 1:\nInput: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = \"RRRRR\"\nOutput: [2,17,9,15,10]\nExplanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction.

Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].\nExample 3:\nInput: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = \"RLRL\"\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed.

We need to find for each -1 the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer.\nTo achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: seen and ans.\nStart iterating from the beginning of the array nums.\nIf a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the front of seen.\nIf -1 is encountered, let k be the number of consecutive -1s seen so far (including the current -1),\nIf k is less than or equal to the length of seen, append the k-th element of seen to ans.\nIf k is strictly greater than the length of seen, append -1 to ans.\nReturn the array ans.\n  Example 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1]\nOutput: [2,1,-1]\nExplanation:\nStart with seen = [] and ans = [].\nProcess nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1].\nProcess nums[1]: The next element is 2. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1].\nProcess nums[2]: The next element is -1. This is the first occurrence of -1, so k == 1. We look for the first element in seen. We append 2 to ans. Now, ans == [2].\nProcess nums[3]: Another -1. This is the second consecutive -1, so k == 2.

    "description": "Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k\nsubstrings\nsuch that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome are minimized.\nReturn the minimum number of letter changes required.\nA semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into\npalindromes\nbased on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:\nChoose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.\nFor a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.\nThe string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.\nConsider the string \"abcabc\":\nThe length of \"abcabc\" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.\nFor d = 1: The entire string \"abcabc\" forms one group. Not a palindrome.\nFor d = 2:\nGroup 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): \"acb\"\nGroup 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): \"bac\"\nNeither group forms a palindrome.\nFor d = 3:\nGroup 1 (positions 1, 4): \"aa\"\nGroup 2 (positions 2, 5): \"bb\"\nGroup 3 (positions 3, 6): \"cc\"\nAll groups form palindromes. Therefore, \"abcabc\" is a semi-palindrome.\n  Example 1:\nInput: s = \"abcac\", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Divide s into \"ab\" and \"cac\". \"cac\" is already semi-palindrome. Change \"ab\" to \"aa\", it becomes semi-palindrome with d = 1.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Divide s into substrings \"abc\" and \"def\". Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome.\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Divide s into substrings \"aa\", \"bb\" and \"aa\". All are already semi-palindromes.\n  Constraints:\n2 <= s.length <= 200\n1 <= k <= s.length / 2\ns contains only lowercase English letters.",

The number of coins to be placed at node i can be calculated as:\nIf size of the subtree of node i is less than 3, place 1 coin.\nOtherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node i. If this product is negative, place 0 coins.\nReturn an array coin of size n such that coin[i] is the number of coins placed at node i.\n  Example 1:\nInput: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]], cost = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: [120,1,1,1,1,1]\nExplanation: For node 0 place 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 coins.

    "description": "You are given m x n grid image which represents a grayscale image, where image[i][j] represents a pixel with intensity in the range [0..255]. You are also given a non-negative integer threshold.\nTwo pixels are adjacent if they share an edge.\nA region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold.\nAll pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions.\nYou need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded-down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] does not belong to any region, result[i][j] is equal to image[i][j].\nReturn the grid result.\n  Example 1:\nInput: image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3\nOutput: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]\nExplanation:\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.\nPlease note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.\nExample 2:\nInput: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12\nOutput: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]\nExplanation:\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.\nAll the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.\nExample 3:\nInput: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1\nOutput: [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]\nExplanation:\nThere is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image.\n  Constraints:\n3 <= n, m <= 500\n0 <= image[i][j] <= 255\n0 <= threshold <= 255",
